# ❌⭕ Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe  
### Event-Driven Microservices Game  
**React + Python + Kafka + WebSocket + K3s**

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a **multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game** built using a **real microservices architecture**.

The goal is not game complexity, but to demonstrate and practice:

- Event-driven architecture
- Microservices separation
- WebSocket real-time communication
- Kafka as an event bus
- Python backend using virtual environments (venv)
- React frontend
- Kubernetes deployment using K3s

This is a production-style architecture applied to a simple game.

## 2. Game Description

### Game Type
- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe
- Board size: **3 × 3**
- Exactly **2 players**

### Player Symbols
- Player 1 → **X**
- Player 2 → **O**

## 3. Game Rules

### Turn Rules
- Players take turns alternately
- Only the player whose turn it is may make a move
- A player cannot play twice in a row

### Move Rules
- A move consists of selecting a `(row, col)` on the board
- The selected cell must be empty
- Moves are rejected if:
  - It is not the player’s turn
  - The cell is already occupied
  - The game has already ended

### Win Condition
A player wins if they place three of their symbols:
- In a row
- In a column
- In a diagonal

### Draw Condition
- The board is full
- No player has won

### Game End
- When a win or draw is detected:
  - The game status becomes `GAME_OVER`
  - No further moves are accepted
  - All players are notified

## 4. Core Design Principle

**The server is authoritative.**

- The frontend never decides:
  - Whether a move is valid
  - Whose turn it is
  - Who won
- The frontend only:
  - Sends move intent
  - Renders the game state received from the server
